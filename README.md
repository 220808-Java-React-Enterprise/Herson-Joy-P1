## Description
A backend API for an employee reimbursement system.

## Usage
- Admin
    - Approve pending User registration
- Employee
    
    - Create new reimbursement requests
    - View reimbursement requests (sortable/filterable)
    - Modify pending reimbursement requests

## Brief
"For the foundations module of your training you are tasked with building an API that will support a new internal expense reimbursement system. This system will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All registered employees in the company can login and submit requests for reimbursement and view their past tickets and pending requests. Finance managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Finance managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursement."

## User Story
As an administrator, I want to have control over who is allowed to access the system and make updates to those users. As an employee, I want to be able to
create new reimbursement requests and view/modify my requests.
